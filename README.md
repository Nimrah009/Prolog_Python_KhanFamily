# Prolog_Python_KhanFamily
Here I have integrated python and prolog to built a knowledge based project with respect to Khan Family Tree.
First of all we integrated Python version 3.7 with Prolog version swipl-w64-764.
## Problem Statment:
            We have a Family Tree, our task was to use python as a frontend and prolog as a backend coding languages so, we can find our favourite relatives from family tree.
